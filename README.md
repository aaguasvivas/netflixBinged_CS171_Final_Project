<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Netflix Binged Screen Shot][binged-screenshot]](https://cs171binged.com/)

Netflix Binged is a web application focused on analyzing Netflix's success. The reason why we chose Netflix was because all three of us love it. We spent a lot of our time coding together discussing what shows and movies we would be watching after the coding session is over. Therefore, wanted to create a space where users can learn more about the platform. We focused heavily on stats, as well as what sets Netflix apart. We broke it down to several different sections on why we believe Netflix has become such a powerhouse in the industry. Netflix remains atop of the number of subscribers list by a huge margin, for several reasons, namely their huge number of listings, content diversity, high ratings, and strong international presence. Each corresponding section has data and visualizations to explore, visualize and back our claims.

We tried to make navigating the website as simple as possible, while still giving it that Netflix aesthetic that is such a critical part of the platform. We use fullpage.js, which allows you to scroll from section to section, slide by slide. Some sections have arrows that point to different visualizations and parts of the website. We go from background stats, to our core points, to finally providing you with the movies and tv shows we love or have been meaning to start watching.

We hope you enjoy taking a deeper look at what makes Netflix THE online streaming platform to beat, as well as exploring the things we personally love about it.

### Built With

This project is a culmination of all of the work and learning we did for our class, CS171: Visualization at Harvard University. The major programming languages and frameworks we used include:

- [D3.js](https://d3js.org/)
- [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)
- [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
- [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

If you want to view the project, you can do so by visiting [this website](https://cs171binged.com/): https://cs171binged.com/.

If you want to see a demo of this project, you can do so by visiting [this link](https://youtu.be/mW2P7d2TUAk)

If you want to set up your own local version, follow the steps below where we outline an example of the software needed, how to install it, important commands and how to get things running.

### Prerequisites

First, we will need an IDE. We personally used WebStorm to develop the website, as it was the main IDE used in class, but also because it is a very powerful IDE for JavaScript, providing you with several features, such as code completion, error handling, and a quick and intuitive way to get your index.html up and running.

- [WebStorm by JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/aaguasvivas/netflixBinged_CS171_Final_Project.git
   ```
2. Open WebStorm

3. Through WebStorm, locate the project and open it

4. Click on index.html

5. Locate the symbol of your favorite web browser and click it

6. You should see a local version of the website!

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

The goal of this project was to give a complete overview of Netflix as a company, and analyze why they have been so sucessful, using data and visualizations. We start off by looking at Netflix's number of subscribers compared to other online streaming platforms, as well as its revenue over the years. Netflix is number one across the board, in every category imaginable, and we believe it is because of their huge number of listings, content diversity, high ratings, and strong international presence.

Below is our background for the project:

### Libraries Used

Most of our code was written by us and inspired by the material learned in the course through labs and homeworks. However, below are some of the libraries we used to carry out some of our ideas. These libraries were incredibly helpful in giving the page the feel and information we wanted.

- [fullPage.js](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/): For the one page scroll layout.
- [World Atlas TopoJSON](https://github.com/topojson/world-atlas): Pre-built TopoJSON from Natural Earth allowed us to create the map visualization very quickly and effectively. This was also inspired by the Week 8 Lab.
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/): Used to design and customize some of our tables in the Viewer Enjoyment section quickly
- [noUiSlider](https://refreshless.com/nouislider): Used to develop the sliders on the Viewer Enjoyment rating guessing section.
- [Tabulator](http://tabulator.info/): For the tables in the International Presence section
- [CSS Scroll Down Button](https://codepen.io/nxworld/pen/OyRrGy): For the scroll down arrows in the landing page
