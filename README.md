<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Netflix Binged Screen Shot][binged-screenshot]](https://cs171binged.com/)

GIVE BRIEF PROJECT EXPLANATION/MOTIVATIONS/DESCRIPTION

### Built With

This project is a culmination of all of the work and learning we did for our class, CS171: Visualization at Harvard University. The major programming languages and frameworks we used include:

- [D3.js](https://d3js.org/)
- [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)
- [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
- [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

If you want to view the project, you can do so by visiting [this website](https://cs171binged.com/): https://cs171binged.com/.

If you want to set up your own local version, follow the steps below where we outline an example of the software needed, how to install it, important commands and how to get things running.

### Prerequisites

First, we will need an IDE. We personally used WebStorm to develop the website, as it was the main IDE used in class, but also because it is a very powerful IDE for JavaScript, providing you with several features, such as code completion, error handling, and a quick and intuitive way to get your index.html up and running.

- [WebStorm by JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/aaguasvivas/netflixBinged_CS171_Final_Project.git
   ```
2. Open WebStorm

3. Through WebStorm, locate the project and open it

4. Click on index.html

5. Locate the symbol of your favorite web browser and click it

6. You should see a local version of the website!

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

The goal of this project was to give a complete overview of Netflix as a company, and analyze why they have been so sucessful, using data and visualizations. We start off by looking at Netflix's number of subscribers compared to other online streaming platforms, as well as its revenue over the years. Netflix is number one across the board, in every category imaginable, and we believe it is because of their huge number of listings, content diversity, high ratings, and strong international presence.

Below is our background for the project:
